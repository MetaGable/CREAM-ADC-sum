# CREAM L1 data

### Goals
Our goal is to produce L1 data (convert ADC into Energy units). We are currently deriving the gain for mid ranged channels.   

### Notes on our scripts
###### ScatterV8.py
 - Create data files for Plot_tackedV2.py to plot. It organizes event signal based on ribbons and creates pairs containing low range and mid range ADC. 

###### Plot_tackedV2.py
 - Plot and fit the result from scatter for recontructed data.
